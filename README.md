# Sunbreeze
A tech demo heavily inspired on the [@NewWhoreizons](https://twitter.com/newwhoreizons) Twitter account *(and yes, on the Animal Crossing franchise).* Previously intended to be a fangame, the project has been cancelled, and it now serves as a (somewhat incomplete) pixel-art visual novel and top-down game engine.

Written in Gamemaker Studio 2 using GML. No binaries are available - feel free to compile it if you have the engine.
