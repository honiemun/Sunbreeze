# Sunbreeze
A WIP tech demo (game?) heavily inspired on the [@NewWhoreizons](twitter.com/newwhoreizons) Twitter account *(and yes, on the Animal Crossing franchise).* Currently it serves as a bit of a pixel-art visual novel and top-down game engine.

Written in Gamemaker Studio 2 using GML. No binaries at the moment - compile it if you have the engine, or wait for an official release later down the line.
